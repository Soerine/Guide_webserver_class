                    <h1>Cacti - the Coolest Plant Ever</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising
                        about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales. </p>


                    <p>The word "cactus" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used
                        by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes
                        and sizes. </p>

                    <p>Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments,
                        even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations
                        to conserve water.</p>

                    <p>Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike
                        many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place.
                        Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves.</p>


                    <p>As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to
                        the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis.
                        Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada
                        in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka. </p>

                <h1>Stems</h1>
                <p>The leafless, spiny stem is the characteristic feature of the majority of cacti (and all of those belonging
                    to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to
                    store water. </p>

                <p>The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various
                    kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small "bumps" to prominent, nipple-like shapes
                    in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be
                    ribbed or fluted in shape. </p>

                <p>The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass
                    of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus
                    is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.</p>

                <p>The stems of most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or brownish green. Such stems contain chlorophyll
                    and are able to carry out photosynthesis; they also have stomata (small structures that can open and
                    close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy</p>

                <h1>Leaves</h1>

                <p>The great majority of cacti have no visible leaves; photosynthesis takes place in the stems (which may be
                    flattened and leaflike in some species). Exceptions occur in three groups of cacti. All the species of
                    Pereskia are superficially like normal trees or shrubs and have numerous leaves. </p>

                <p>Many cacti in the opuntia group (subfamily Opuntioideae, opuntioids) also have visible leaves, which may
                    be long-lasting (as in Pereskiopsis species) or be produced only during the growing season and then be
                    lost (as in many species of Opuntia). The small genus Maihuenia also relies on leaves for photosynthesis.
                    The structure of the leaves varies somewhat between these groups. </p>

                <p>Pereskia species have "normal" leaves, with a midrib and a flattened blade (lamina) on either side. Opuntioids
                    and Maihuenia have leaves that appear to consist only of a midrib. Even those cacti without visible photosynthetic
                    leaves do usually have very small leaves, less than 0.5 mm (0.02 in) long in about half of the species
                    studied and almost always less than 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. The function of such leaves cannot be photosynthesis;
                    a role in the production of plant hormones, such as auxin, and in defining axillary buds has been suggested.</p>
